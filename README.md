# NGS_analysis
Analysis of NGS data from gene editing experiments performed with PE system and variants. The code for quick analysis is written on `bash` and it is aimed at finding specific editing alleles through pattern matching ( `grep` ). Data are stored in `Marvin` cluster. For a more complex analysis (like NHEJ detection), I use [CRISPResso2](http://crispresso2.pinellolab.org/submission) and [CRISPR-A](https://synbio.upf.edu/crispr-a/). For running CRISPResso over multiple fastq files, I use the extension `CRISPRessoBatch` with a script including python to generate input file (`batch file`) and run CRISPRessoBatch using a singularity generated in the cluster by Marta.
